# jtd-frdr: A custom Jekyll theme for FRDR resources

jtd-frdr was forked from the [scds/jtd-mcmaster](https://github.com/scds/jtd-mcmaster) theme (built using the standard [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) documentation theme) and provides a modern, highly customizable, branded and responsive Jekyll theme for resource documents developed by the FRDR service team.

The theme can be easily hosted on GitHub Pages with few dependencies and supports the [Jekyll Multiple Languages Plugin](https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file).
