jtd-frdr was forked from the [scds/jtd-mcmaster](https://github.com/scds/jtd-mcmaster) (built using the standard [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) documentation theme) and provides a modern, highly customizable, and responsive Jekyll theme for resource documents developeed by the FRDR service team.
